- Fund Size -> The latest identifiable size (exact value as provided, including currency symbol and denomination like $10M or €50M)
- Invested to Date -> The latest identifiable total investment amount deployed. If not mentioned specifically, analyse each investment made for each portfolio company and add them, output will be the final total with denomination.
- Minimum Check Size -> The latest identifiable minimum investment amount per deal
- # of Portfolio Companies -> Total number of portfolio companies in which the fund has invested, if not directly available, calculate the total number of company names under their active portfolio, list of companies under "investment name" or "track record"

- Female Partner in Fund -> If any partners are female, output ; otherwise set to false
- Minority (BIPOC) Partner in Fund -> If any partners are not of caucasian ethnicity, output will be true; otherwise set to false

Return the extracted data as a JSON object with the keys exactly as given above.
If any field cannot be determined from the text, set its value to null.

Your output must follow this exact format without any additional keys or formatting:

{
  "Fund Manager": "<value or null(Name of the fund management company or partnership (fund family name only; exclude fund number like I or II))>",

  "Minority (BIPOC) Partner in Fund": "<true/false/null(If any partners are not of caucasian ethnicity, output will be true; otherwise set to false)>"
}
